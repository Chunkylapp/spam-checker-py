    ---------------------------- Introduction --------------------------------

    Both programs, written in C and Python, are built using the same principle:
they are separated into 2 major functions, task_1() and task_2() which, as the
name suggests, fulfill tasks 1 and 2.
    Each separate file (task_1.c/py and task_2.c/py) hold functions used
primarily for that task.

    ----------------- Program coded using the Python language -----------------

    In python I am using a files array which holds the filenames, a keywords
dictionary and a spread dictionary. We read each filename, each keywords and
populate the spread with 0 values. After that we iterate through each file
and get the occurences for the keys inside the spread dictionary. We call the
doWork() function (nice name, I know) to open the output file, iterate through
each key and calculate the spread.
    The 2nd task uses a files array and a keywords dictionary. We get the
average size using a function with the same name, we count the keywords
for each file, get the lenght in chars and words, see weather it has more
than half of its chars capitalized, get the value inside the data/spammers
file and calculate the score. If the score > 55 we print 1, if it's less
we print 0.

    ------------------------ Thoughts and feelings ----------------------------

    Overall it was a nice challenge. The coding part was not the hard one,
but the research. I read each email and checked for words that might help
me identify it as spam. I needed more keywords so I started to search online,
form key sentences and words that are usually encountered in spam emails.
    I had to change the formula given in the documentation for each program,
just to realize there was way more work to be done ahead of me. Time was
running out, so I decided to leave it as it is. Now I know why we use
machine learning for these types of tasks.


    Accurate representation of me after realizing I was doing a machine
learning algorithm's work:
